# SuperClicky
SuperClicky is a memory game I made over the 2016-17 winter break. The current version has 7 levels using a 3x3 game board. Each level has an increasing number of tiles from 3 to 9, with the position and color of the tiles being randomly generated. 

As of yet there is nothing preventing the RNG from dealing you a set of unicolored tiles, nor is there anything preventing you from getting the exact same playable board as the goal board for any given level (meaning you win automatically). As soon as I find some extra time, I'll sort that out. For now, if you aren't so lucky and you do get stuck on a level (which can happen surprisingly enough), then you can press the 'H' key to see a hint. It does make you a dirty cheater, but if you can live with that then go for it.

####Latest Update:
Since I am taking 6 CS classes my final semester, I probably won't be working on this for a few months.

####SuperClicky Prototype:
If you'd like to check the game out (and you really should since you came all the way here), then you can download the runnable JAR from the main page or get it [here](https://github.com/tmryan/SuperClicky/raw/master/SuperClicky.jar).
